The import statement is used to import functionality from the existing modules.
Each application consists of Components. 
Each component is a logical boundary of functionality for the application.
You need to have layered services, which are used to share the functionality across components.


A component consists of −

Class − This is like a C++ or Java class which consists of properties and methods.

Metadata − This is used to decorate the class and extend the functionality of the class.

Template − This is used to define the HTML view which is displayed in the application.

app.component.ts --->it is main component
app.module.ts ------> it is main module and all component are attach to main module 


*******************

angular2 is component based approch 
component are the individual and free peice of logic and view
everything in angular2 is component based 

typescrip :- here we code in typescript and typescript is toatlly object oriented programming  it is class base

Component :- it is individual piece of module,
			 which can contain specific view and method of app.
			 
	1.Template :- html viw of the component, can contain data-binding and directive 			 
					ex: login component when we access login component we will see login form 
	2.class :- clasess can contain the method and properties of the components
				after click on login which functionality  running  

	3.decorator/metadata :-it provide additional informative data about component to the angular app
				like it tells which selector,which template many things like that
				
				
AppModule :- it is root module which boostrap and launches the angular application 

BOTH interpolation and property binding flows a data value in one direction 
i.e from component class property to an html element property 

interpollation vc  propertybinding
------------------------------------
interpolation is a special syntex that angular converts into property binding 
to concatinate string we must use interpolation instead of property binding 
to set an element property to a non-string data-value ,you must use property binding 

angular databinding is all about binding to DOM object properties not a html element attribute 
interpolation bind component class property to DOM property not to attribute of html element ex:-collspan attribute does not have corresponding property in the DOM 

#interpolation and property binding deal with binding component class properties to html element properties and not atribute

following thses binding flow data in one direction i.e from a component class property to an html element property 
1.interpolation 
2.property Binding
3.Attribute Binding 
4.class binding
5.style binding 

#eventBinding :-flow data in opposite  direction i.e from an html element property to a component class property

for property binding we are using pair of square bracket 
for Event binding we are using pair of parenthesis
 
angular databinding is combination of property binding and event binding 
to save several keystroke and simplify angular two way databinding ,angular has provided ngModel directive 
to use ngModule we should import FormsModule in root module i.e app.module

employee : any[]{
}
here 'any' is type of array which allow any type of object to be added to this array  and it is not good practice  

 				
ngFor dirctive is typically use to iterate over list of items 
ngFor : if it is small list we dont have performance issue but if it large list we face performance issue so use ngtrackBy

using trackBy may improve the performs of appliocation 

pipes : transform data before display 
built in pipe provided by angular :-lowercase,uppercase,decimal,date,currency 

#to pass properties from parent component  to the child component
we will have to convert child component properties into input properties for so we have to decorate this properties to input decorator/metadata



A service in angular is generally used when you need to reuse data or logic accross multiple component
in angular service is nothing but class
constructer is not right place to call service 
service call usually issued over a http to remote web server 
what is right place of serviec call ?
:- ngOnInit life cycle hook is the best place of service call 
	ngOnInit is executed after the constructer and it is used for component instialisation and making service call
	
Diff Class constructer and NgOnInit
:-


proverder property of component Decorator  to register our EmployeeService with angular Dependancy injection system

call server side web api services using angular http built in serivice 
http service presentin different angualr module 
 step1: within the root module (AppModule), import angular HTTP module 
        with this change we can now able use angular bilt in http services
		
step 2: modify EmployeeService to issue  a GET request using the built in http services		
		

what is observable ?
:-an observale is asynchronous pattern 
  in this pattern we have observable and observerer
 observable :- emmits data item on notification over a periiod of time 
 observerer(subscriber)	:- can subscribe to  observable 
						  when subscribing to observable specify the callback function 
						  that callback functio of observerer is notified whenever this observable emimit data item 
						  within that function we will write the code to handle the data item emmited by the observable
						  
	observable can have multiple observerer(subscriber)
 
 
step 3: From EmployeeListComponent ,subscribe to the observable returned by angular EmployeeServices
				
				
to install bostrap library into node use fallowing commond
1.run node.js commond propmt as run as administrator
2.opon upto project directory through common propmt
3.then type commond :- npm install bootstrap@3 jquery --save 


to use AngularMultiSelectModule add dependancy to root module
open project dir in cmd and type commond : npm install angular2-multiselect-dropdown
and import in root module 
 -->import { AngularMultiSelectModule } from 'angular2-multiselect-dropdown/angular2-multiselect-dropdown';
 
 
Two way s to create forms in agular
1.Templete Driven form 
2.Model driven Forms(commonly called reactive forms)



every form is combination of one or more FormControl

component input property are typically used to passed data from parent component 
to child component and import the Import Decorator from core
ex: 
child-compo:- @Input() emp: EmployeeListComponent or employee   
parent-compo:-
	html-->
			 <div *ngFor="let employee of employees">
				<child-compo [emp]="employee" > </child-compo> 
			  <div>
			  
-----======*******-========-------			  
to pass data from child component to parent component we use Output property 

child-compo:- @Output() notify: EventEmitter<string> =new EventEmitter<string>();
			handleClick()
			{
				this.notify.emmit(this.employee.name);
			}

parent compo :- 			
html-->
			<h1 *ngIf="dataFromChild">
				{{dataFromChild?.name +''+dataFromChild?.gender }}
			<h1>	
			 <div *ngFor="let employee of employees">
				<child-compo [emp]="employee" (notify)="handleNotify($event)" > </child-compo> 
			  <div>
at controller :-recieves the emploee name in 
				handleNotify(eventData: string )
				{
				 this.dataFromChild=eventData;		
				}

why  are we setting the type of our output property to an EventEmmiter object 
thats because a  child component usess an event to pass data to an parent component 								
what data we want to pass and when we do we want to pass that data  				
when their is click event on the employee Panel
EventEmmiter object help us to emmit a custom event 
eventData is comonly called as even payload
in the view templete of  parent component we need to bind this custom notify event 
when the child component raised this event it also going to pass employee name as event data
and $event object is going to recevice that event payload 
? safe navigation operator 


				
 how to call child component properties and methods from parent component using templete refference variable?
-->one way to do this by using Output Property 
  another way to this by using templete refference variable
  
  in the view templete of parent component 
  create templete refference variable tha point to our child  component
  which is used to call any of the child component public property and methods 
  

href :-   
	 <base href="/" > this means all our navigation url now will be relative
	 to the root of the application
	 since we set base as this all the other url now relative to roo of application
	 
create component 
:
ng g c employees\displayEmployee --flat --no-spec


onChanges method is call every time when input property of this comonent is changes 
and changes to the input property are pass into this method as a parameter and parameter has type 
and that type is SimpleChanges  and that available in angular core 




creating and reading queryString paramter is some what similar to creating reading optional route paramter
querystring paramter in the url start with the ?
and if multiple querystring paramterseprated with &

query paramter are usually used when you want the paramter on the route to be optional 
and when u want to retain those paramter acrose multiple routes 

just like optional route paramter ,query paramter are not part of route configuration 
and therfore they are not used in route pattern matching. 



Templete Driven form 
-----------------------
create templeteReference variable which will reffer to our form using ngForm Directive 
(ngForm dirctive is present in or provided  FormsModule so import Forsmodule in root module)
this ngForm directive suppliments this form element with additional feutures and properties like 
dirty ,touch,valid , value etc

template refference variable meaning it hold the reference to the entire form 
ngForm directive is attach to form element whenever angular see the form tag
behind the scen angular automatically create automatically form for us 


reactive form is represented by a model
this model is responcible for handling all the user interaction  with the form 
two clsess are used to create the MDF
1.FormControl
2.FormGroup

#in mdf ,a form is represented by model ,model is responcible for handling all the user interaction with the forms
if form contain more than 20 filed then form looks messyand for this reason we have formBuilder class
formBuilder class is used to build forms and it is just syntactically improvement in creating the model driven form

a template driven form, which is hard to scale, and maintain.

Version 3.0.0 is not stable. Go for latest stable version 2.0.5
npm install ngx-bootstrap@2.0.5 --save


There is an important difference between them and that is:
Reactive forms are synchronous while Template-driven forms are asynchronous.






Routing And Navigation
-======================---

Using angular router we can navigate from one view to next while performing our task.
Every component can be mapped with a URL and when that URL is accessed by browser or 
by a link on the page then the corresponding component is displayed.
We can pass optional parameter with the URL that will be fetched in component to filter data to display.
In our HTML template we can bind router to a link and when link is clicked,it will navigate to appropriate view.
We can configure a URL to redirect to next URL.We can also handle "404 Not Found" in angular routing. 
Angular routing provides location service using which we can go back and forward through the history of pages using a button.
Here on this page first we will discuss the angular routing API and then we will create a book library for routing and navigation demo

To work with angular routing and navigation, first we need to understand their API.
Angular routing provides services, directives and operators that manage the routing and navigation in our application.
Here we will provide API description and their usability in our routing application  
 
1. RouterModule and Routes
:-RouterModule is a separate module in angular that provides required services and directives 
to use routing and navigation in angular application. 
Routes defines and array of roots that map a path to a component. 
Paths are configured in module to make available it globally.
To use RouterModule and Routes in module, find the steps.  
1.First of all we will import RouterModule and Routes in our component.
2.Create array of Routes in which we map a URL with a component.
a. Mapping a Route to a Component
:-{ path: 'manage-book', component: ManageBookComponent } 
b. Configure Parameters 
:-{ path: 'update-book/:id', component: UpdateBookComponent } 
c. Redirect to a URL
	:-{ path: '', redirectTo: '/manage-book ', pathMatch: 'full' } 
		If we access a URL without specifying any component path such as "/" then it will be redirected to URL /manage-book path and hence by default ManageBookComponent will be displayed. 
d. Handling "Page Not Found" 
	:-{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent } 
		If we access path that has no mapping with any component, then to handle 404 Not Found error, we use a path (**) that is mapped with any component to show desired message.


3. Using RouterModule.forRoot() 
	:- Now we need to import RouterModule.forRoot(routes) using imports metadata of @NgModule.
	Here argument routes is our constant that we have defined above as array of Routes to map path with component.


angular route parameter
------------------------
:- 
this.router.navigate(['/employees',employeeId]);
or
<a [routerLink]="['/employees',2]">getwiTH iD2 </a>

reading parameter value  : this.route.snapshot.params['id'] it return value as string convert it into number by + symbal
		const Id=+this.route.snapshot.params['id']
the above way are used in angualr 2 now it is depricatd in angular 4 and above version we use 
ex:-	const Id=+this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
 observable aproch
 
 this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params =>{
	const Id=+params.get('id');
	
 })
 
optional route parameter
-------------------------
<a class="btn btn-primary" [routerLink]="['list',{ id : employee.id , name : employee.name }]" >Back To List </a>
 this.selectedId=+this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
 
 
Query string route parameter
------------------------------ 
passing query string paramtere in code 
:- this.router.navigate(['/employees',employeeId],
     { querParams  : { 'searchTerm ' : this.searchTerm },{ 'testParam ' : 'testValue ' } 
   );

passing query string paramtere in the HTML
:- <a [routerLink]= "['/employees']"
	  [ queryParams ]= "{ ' searchTerm' : : 'john' , 'testParam': 'testValue' }">List 
   </a>
   
preserve query string parameter in code 
:- this.router.navigate(['/employees',employeeId],
     {
		querParamsHandling  : 'preserve'
	 }
   );    
	  
preserve query string paramtere in the HTML
:- <a [routerLink]= "['/list']"
	  queryParamsHandling="preserve">Back To List
   </a>
queryParamsHandling is introduce in angular 4 
if u r using angular 2 ,use preserveQueryParams
preserveQueryParams is depricated since angualr 4


code will execute for every time whenever username control changes. 
#for valueChanges with FormControl
	this.userForm.get('forControlName').valueChanges.subscribe(
	  uname => {
		console.log('Username changed:' + uname);
	  }
	); 

	If we create a getter property for our control as following
	get forControlName() {
	 return this.userForm.get('forControlName');
	} 
	Then we can call valueChanges as given below.
	this.forControlName.valueChanges.subscribe(
	  uname => {
		console.log('Username changed:' + uname);
	  }
	);

	
#for valueChanges with FormArray
	this.userForm.get('FormArrayName').valueChanges.subscribe(
	  data => {
		console.log('favoriteLocations: ' + data);
	  }
	); 	
	we create a getter property for our control as following
	get FormArrayName() {
	   return this.userForm.get('FormArrayName');
	} 
	Then we can call valueChanges as given below.
	this.FormArrayName.valueChanges.subscribe(
	  data => {
		console.log('favoriteLocations: ' + data);
	  }
	); 
	  

#for valueChanges with FormGroup		

this.userForm.valueChanges.subscribe((user: User) => {
	console.log('username: '+ user.username);
	console.log('Password: '+ user.password);
});
